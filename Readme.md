Project Overview

  This project analyzes the Kaggle Healthcare Appointment No-Show dataset (110k+ medical appointments) to uncover patterns behind patient attendance and no-shows.
  Using SQL Server for data cleaning and transformation, and Excel for building an interactive dashboard, the project highlights key factors that influence whether patients attend or miss appointments.

Tools & Technologies

  SQL Server → Data cleaning, transformations, and analytical queries

  Microsoft Excel → PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and dashboard building

  Data Visualization → KPI cards, donut charts, stacked columns, bar charts

Key Insights

  SMS reminders reduced no-shows by ~35%, showing the importance of communication.

  Younger patients were more likely to miss their appointments compared to older groups.

  Certain neighborhoods showed disproportionately higher no-show rates, suggesting location-based challenges.

  Lead time (days between scheduling and appointment) strongly impacted attendance patterns.
